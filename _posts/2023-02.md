## Bellarine Sunset Run
I actually made it! The first ever half-marathon. Well done!


## We went surfing!
Thanks Byron for taking me along.


## Oracle meetup
Learn a lot from Zhuohan presentation. Not into the party. Why do I get off Twitter to hear people discuss LLM in real life :

## Maria & Kirill wedding
First time I was invited (sort of) to a non-Vietnamese wedding. Felt like an actual wedding. People are so nice. I went there as my girlfriend's date of course.


## Play
- Hogwart Legacy. Would have enjoyed more if I were into Harry Potter as a kid. Overall, a game made with love and care.
- VCS (Vietnamese league) finally started!

## Watch
- Alice in Borderland (S2)

## Music

## Random

- Didn't get past the CV screening round for HF/Meta/AI2. We go again.
